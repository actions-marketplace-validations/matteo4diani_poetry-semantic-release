# Poetry Semantic Release
A composite GitHub Action to release simple Python packages on GitHub and PyPI following semantic versioning and conventional commits.

## Usage

This action automates [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and distribution of Python projects by leveraging [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

To use it in your CI:
1. Generate a PyPI Token from PyPI: https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken
2. Set your PyPI Token as a repository secret named `PYPI_TOKEN`: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository
3. For a quick start copy the `[tool.semantic_release]` section of this [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/matteo4diani/poetry-semantic-release-test/blob/main/pyproject.toml) and adjust it to your needs.
4. For advanced semantic-release configurations: https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#configuration
